# Lineage

The originating authors of Tiled have worked on several previous, related
projects.

* [**PIMS**](https://soft-matter.github.io/pims/) (2013, JHU Leheny Lab), or Python
  Image Sequence, abstracts over a variety of image time series formats with a
  lazy-loading, numpy-slicable Python object. It has some goals in common with
  [**Dask Array**](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array.html) but it is tightly
  focused on image time series, which lends it
  [ceratin advantages](https://github.com/danielballan/pims2-prototype/issues/1#issuecomment-595653031)
  for that use case. PIMS is still maintained and widely used, including as a
  dependency of [dask-image](https://github.com/dask/dask-image).
* [**Databroker**](https://blueskyproject.io/databroker)
  (2015, Brookhaven National Laboratory) provides searchable dict-like
  "catalogs" of data with entries that ultimately provide N-dimensional or
  tablular data as PIMS objects or [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  DataFrames respectively. It also provides streaming access to data and is
  tightly coupled to the Bluesky "Document Model" for streaming data.
* [**Intake**](https://intake.readthedocs.org/) (2017, Anaconda Inc.) is similar
  to Databroker in its goals and feature set---searchable Catalogs that
  ultimately provide standard SciPy data structures---but its intended scope
  is broader than Databroker's, not being tied to the Bluesky "Document
  Model" in particular. It also supports *nested* Catalogs and chainable
  search queries. In 2018--2020, Databroker was refactored to become a set of
  Intake drivers.

Intake also has a prototype of an HTTP server, which has not yet been fully
developed into a robust tool. Attempts to rework that server led to the
conclusion that Intake's architecture and API privilege ergonomic *interactive*
use and direct access from Python. The changes neccessary to use it as
library code effectively within a performant service or larger application
would be largely *subtractive*, in tension with its use as a user-facing
interactive exploratory tool.

Which brings us to Tiled (2021, Brookhaven National Laboratory with the Bluesky
Collaboration). Tiled is designed with HTTP-based access as the driving use
case, targeting Python clients, browser-based clients, and clients in other
languages. Tiled is compatible with PIMS for reading image series. Tiled has
search capability and some other features drawn from Databroker. Tiled has a
*Catalog* abstraction similar to Intake's, with small but important differences
to suit the server--client interaction. (It is hoped that Tiled Catalogs and
Intake Catalogs can be made interoperable in the near future.) Finally, Tiled
has a *Reader* abstraction that is something like an amalgam of PIMS Readers and
Intake's Datasources.

In summary:

* Tiled can use PIMS internally to efficiently slice and read image series.
* Tiled can probably be made interoperate with Intake objects.
* Databroker will evolve to be a thin wrapper around Tiled, adding
  concepts and capabilties specific to the Bluesky "Document Model".
